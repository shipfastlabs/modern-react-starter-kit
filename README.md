## Introduction

Our React starter kit provides a robust, modern starting point for building Laravel applications with a React frontend using [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com).

Inertia allows you to build modern, single-page React applications using classic server-side routing and controllers. This lets you enjoy the frontend power of React combined with the incredible backend productivity of Laravel and lightning-fast Vite compilation.

This React starter kit utilizes React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind, and the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) and [radix-ui](https://www.radix-ui.com) component libraries.

## Enhanced Features

This kit extends the official Laravel React starter with additional development tools and quality assurance:

- **PHPStan (Maximum Level)**: Static analysis at the highest level for robust type checking
- **Laravel Pint**: Automated styling with opinionated rules approved by Nuno Maduro
- **Rector**: Automated PHP refactoring and upgrades
- **Testing Suite**: 
  - Pest PHP for elegant testing
  - Architecture tests for maintaining code structure
  - Type Coverage for ensuring type safety
- **IDE Helper**: Enhanced IDE support for Laravel facades and models
- **Updated APP Service Provider**: Updated to use some secure and modern practices

> This starter kit is regularly synchronized with the official Laravel React starter kit to ensure you get the latest features and security updates.
